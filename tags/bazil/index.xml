      <description>A lot of time has passed, and a lot of code has been written. Bazil is still in heavy development, but it has reached a good milestone to blog about: it can synchronize changes from one peer to another.
Warning: at this stage in development, we will put no effort into compatibility of file formats or protocols. Do not stare into laser with remaining eye.
What follows is a walkthrough of scenario where we have two computers sharing files &amp;ndash; find me at GopherCon for a live demo, or follow the steps and run it yourself.</description>

      <title>Introducing Bazil</title>

      <description>GopherCon is here, and it is time to reveal what Bazil is all about.
Bazil, also known as bazil.org/bazil, is a file system that lets your data reside where it is most convenient for it to reside.
Bazil is still under heavy development, but welcomes developers and curious power users. Here&#39;s a little teaser of what&#39;s coming.
Imagine you have
  A laptop with a a 256GB SSD  A desktop with a 3TB hard disk  A cloud server or storage service (virtual machine with expandable disks, S3, etc) or  just a cheap computer in a closet with two slow 4TB disks or  external USB disk you plug in once a week for backups  On the desktop, you naturally want to be able to use the whole 3TB disk.</description>
